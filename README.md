# Simple Shell, Checks

There will be no checks released before the deadline. We **strongly** encourage the whole class to work together and create a suite of checks covering both regular tests and edged cases for each task.

Here is an example on how to check your shell.
Fork this repo and add more checks to help you and the rest of the class build the best simple shell possible.

## Configuration

You must have a compilation in the root of your "simple_shell" folder. 
It does not matter the location of your simple shell folder

## Run

Usage `./check_simple_shell.bash`
